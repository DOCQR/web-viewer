## Demystiphy 2D!

BIM software such as Revit and Archicad have been designed to generate a 3D building model, to then produce 2D [paper] drawings.

Once printed, the sections displayed in 2 dimensions might not entail all of the detail necessary to understand the building.
DOC-QR is a tool that aims to visuals those sections, shown in 2D architectural drawings, as trimmed sections of the 3D Revit model, in a web browser.

## Setup
1. `npm install`
  - If no npm/node go to [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install
2. bower install
  - If No bower, use `npm install -g bower` (sudo maybe necessary)
3. npm start
4. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
