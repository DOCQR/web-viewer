#Problem Statement:

## Demystiphy 2D!

BIM software such as Revit and Archicad have been designed to generate a 3D building model, to then produce 2D [paper] drawings.

Once printed, the sections displayed in 2 dimensions might not entail all of the detail necessary to understand the building. 
DOC-QR is a tool that aims to visuals those sections, shown in 2D architectural drawings, as trimmed sections of the 3D Revit model, in a web browser.
